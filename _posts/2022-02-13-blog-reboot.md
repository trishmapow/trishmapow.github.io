## Blog reboot

Bringing this website back to life on free Github pages hosting after trialling a bunch of different web hosts / VPS providers. Some of the old posts have been copied over using the archive.org captures.

Decided to keep it simple and use the template from [Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html). Very easy to add posts by dropping a single Markdown file. Hopefully will update this more often now with new projects.
