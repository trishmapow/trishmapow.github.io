## Quick review: Micsig STO1104C 4CH 100Mhz 1GSa/s portable oscilloscope

(incomplete)

After much research I decided on this Micsig as my first proper (non-USB) oscilloscope. I purchased it from Appvision Australia with 3yr warranty for 867 AUD with all options included besides 1553B/429 decoding. The other major contenders under 1000 AUD were the Rigol DS1054Z, a classic beginner recommendation, and the more premium Siglent SDS1104X-E (both of which are significantly cheaper). In the end, having a battery powered oscilloscope with smart tablet features appealed to me most. The brand reputation and software polish might not be as good but I was willing to take a chance considering the praise it gets on YouTube/EEVBlog forum for ease-of-use.

I won't do a full technical breakdown as other people have done this in a lot of detail, but I will note some things that were different or unexpected.

- The tablet runs a stripped-down version of Android 5.1.1(!) and takes around 25s to boot with an extra 15s to launch the oscilloscope app (passable).
- Cannot install any custom APKs besides using the 'app market' which only has FTP Server and WPS Office, in addition to the updatable built-in apps.
- Responsive touchscreen and buttons.
- Included probes are fixed 10x, which has its advantages but I prefer having the option of 1x.
- Remote control and file transfer (FTP) over WiFi is very convenient and works reasonably well. There is noticeable screen lag however.
- Unique feature of screen recording. Can only start & stop outside of the oscilloscope app though, which is annoying.
- Good premium feel plastic construction.
- Have not found a way to put it into sleep mode. Display has to be on all the time or you have to power off.
- Screen refresh rate seems a bit low - need to investigate this. Quite noticeable when trying to display oscilloscope music in XY mode.
